# open-air-game
## Motivation
During the Covid-19 pandemic, many people were rarely away from home. It was very
unhealthy. In addition, fewer and fewer people want to move to rarely visited places. In order to
promote movement in the yard and encourage people to leave the house, the OpenAir Game
application was created. It allows each user to create their own field game in which any other
user can participate. Thanks to this, everyone will be able to leave the house and, thanks to the
tasks and puzzles, take a walk in healthy air while exploring the game area.

# How to run
In order to run google maps API Key is needed. It has been configured with the app and the only missing piece is the `local.properties` file. This file should be provided in a safe way and only authorized people must have an access to it.
